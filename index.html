    <p id="banana" hidden> Butter: Use softened butter for a soft texture and irresistible butter flavor.
        Brown Sugar: Use all brown sugar in this recipe. In the headnotes for this chocolate chip cookies recipe, I
        explain that brown sugar yields soft and moist cookies. Well, brown sugar works that same magic in banana bread,
        too. It also adds wonderful flavor.
        Eggs: Eggs supply cakes, cupcakes, breads, doughs, and cookies their stability and structure, as well as a
        tender texture. You’ll need 2 large eggs for this.
        Sour Cream or Yogurt: Sour cream or yogurt adds even more moisture to this banana bread. (You can use the 2
        interchangeably in most baking recipes.)

    <p id="muffin" hidden> Preheat oven to 400°F. Line 16 to 18 muffin cups with paper liners (see Notes below).
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Work in the softened butter with a
        fork or pastry cutter. Blend in the eggs, milk, and vanilla until all ingredients are incorporated. Stir in
        desired add-ins, but do not overmix. Evenly divide the batter between the prepared muffin cups.
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the muffins just test done with a toothpick, taking care not to overbake.
        After a few minutes, remove the muffins from the pans and cool on a wire rack, or eat them warm out of the oven
        with a pat of salted butter.</p>
